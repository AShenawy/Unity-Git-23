Welcome to Unity with Git!

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows. 

What you need to know is that you always have to keep your software updated! Trust the automatic notifications and do as you are told, it will save a lot of trouble and keep the project in flow.
